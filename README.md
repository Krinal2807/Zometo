Description

Zomato is a leading online food delivery platform that connects customers with a wide range of restaurants. With a vast network of partner restaurants, Zomato aims to offer diverse culinary options to its users. The dataset provided includes two tables: "Location" and "Rating." The "Location" table contains crucial information about restaurants, such as their names, locations, cuisines, and cities. The "Rating" table provides insights into restaurant performance, including ratings, votes, and cost details. This dataset will serve as a valuable resource for Zomato to analyze restaurant data and gain insights into customer preferences, allowing for better decision-making and strategy formulation.
